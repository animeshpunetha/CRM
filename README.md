# CRM Web Application

Organizations often rely on multiple disconnected tools‚Äîspreadsheets, shared drives, generic scheduling apps‚Äîto manage contacts and sales workflows. This fragmentation leads to missed follow-ups, inaccurate forecasting, and wasted time. Moreover, many out-of-the-box CRMs are either overly complex or too expensive for small and mid-sized teams.

This CRM brings all critical sales workflows under one roof. Every stakeholder‚Äîwhether admin, sales rep, or manager‚Äîhas instant access to the data they need. The modular architecture means you can enable only the features you need, keeping the interface clean and the learning curve low.
A full-stack **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** web application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS**. This system is designed to help sales teams manage leads, deals, contacts, accounts, and recurring revenue streams effectively.
